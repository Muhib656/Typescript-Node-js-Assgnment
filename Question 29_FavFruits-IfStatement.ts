// Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.
// • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.

// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!


// create an array
let favouriteFruit = ["Mango", "Banana", "Orange"]

// creating 5 if statements
